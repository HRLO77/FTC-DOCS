# pre-requisites to setup
* Two android phones with the FTC challenge app installed.
* Turn on usb debugging on both phones (tap the build option in phone information in the settings 9 times).
* *(preferred)* Get a laptop setup for coding.
* *(preferred)* Basic knowledge in Java programming and OOP.
* Expansion / control hub, basic motors, sensor and/or other items i.e servos and motor encoders.
# using the expansion hub
### first steps
  - Connect a battery to the hub via an XT connector (one that lines up with the battery port on the hub and the battery).
  - Connect the phone that is not the driver (wallpaper that does not say driver station on our current phones) to the expansion hub via a mini USB on the expansion hub, and convert to micro usb using a usb to micro-usb connector.
  - From here, the phone wired to the hub should start a wifi network. To see the password, press options, and "Program and Manage". Wait a few minutes for it to load, and it should display network info (like password). Connect the driver station to this network *(and laptop as well, if you have one.)*
  - To connect the driver station to a gamepad, connect the gamepad via a usb to micro-usb connector to the driver station.
  - To sync up the gamepad as player one, press start+a.
### pre-requisites to programming
To start programming, either on the phone wired to the hub *(or laptop if setup in first steps)* follow these steps.
On the laptop / PC, connect to the IP *(our current ip for our expansion  hub is 192.168.49.1)*, (you must be connected to the hub's transmitted wifi network) and route to the port specified *(usually 8080)*. For example, go to `http://192.168.49.1:8080` to program on a PC / laptop. *(You must use the http protocol because https encryption is not supported.)*
