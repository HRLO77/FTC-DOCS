## pre-requisites
* Two android phones with the FTC challenge app installed.
* Turn on usb debugging on both phones (tap the build option in phone information in the settings 9 times).
* *(preferred)* Get a laptop setup for coding.
* *(preferred)* Basic knowledge in Java programming and OOP.
* Expansion / control hub, basic motors, sensor and/or other items i.e servos and motor encoders.
## basic setup up for the expansion hub
### first steps
  - Connect a battery to the hub via an XT connector (one that lines up with the battery port on the hub and the battery).
  - Connect the phone that is not the driver (wallpaper that does not say driver station on our current phones) to the expansion hub via a mini USB on the expansion hub,
  - and convert to micro usb using a usb to micro-usb connector.
  - From here, the phone wired to the hub should start a wifi network. To see the password, press options, and Program and Manage. Wait a few minutes for it to load,
  - and it should display network info (like password). Connect the driver station to this network *(and laptop as well, if you have one.)*
  - To connect the driver station, connect the gamepad via a usb to micro-usb connector to the driver station.
  - To sync up the gamepad as player one or player two, press start+a or start+b.
